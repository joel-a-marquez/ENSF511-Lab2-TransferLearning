# ENSF 511 (W2022) - Lab 2: Transfer Learning

The primary objective of the lab is to look into the behaviour and the performance of transfer learning depending on the layers transferred with the Bobcat dataset. This idea was referenced from an experiment conducted by [Yosinki](https://yosinski.com/media/papers/Yosinski__2014__NIPS__How_Transferable_with_Supp.pdf) in 2014. This lab aims to also confirm their findings with the BobCat dataset which will be imbedded into the [cifar10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
dataset.

Details on the work and the findings will be on the jupyter notebook (**Part1-TL_Analysis.ipynb**). Discussions will also be included to explain and reflect on the results. This covers the first part of Lab 2.

**Part2-NewModel_Analysis.ipynb** contains the second part of Lab 2 in the attempt to develop and improve a new model.
The new model will be devloped with the [Fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) library for a higher-level and easier use in producing a model.
